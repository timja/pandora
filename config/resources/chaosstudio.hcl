    ## discussion with tom: probably needs to be handwritten
    # Users would only be able to enable one capability on a target per resource
    # by that I mean if they wanted to enable several capabilities on a target they'd need to define
    # multiple of these resources using the same chaos_target_id
    # I actually think a better use experience would be to provide a list of capabilities you'd want to have enabled on a single target
    # this means this would need to be completely handwritten
  }
  # allow generation of scoped resources - DONE
  # overwrite method with generate_create = false - DONE
  # scope property name? target_resource_id
  # create method needs to be manually written, what is the order of events - write create method manually first or after?
  # handwrite a chaos_studio_target_resource_gen.go containing bare minimum e.g. resource struct, model struct - then generate
}
# flat additional properties in the swagger parser as a dictionary map[string]interface{}

# allow empty properties payload toggle for resource
